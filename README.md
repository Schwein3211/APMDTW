# Similarity Measure of Time Series Based on Angle-distance Penalized Metric Dynamic Time Warping

# Introduction
This repository provides source codes of the proposed Similarity Measure of Time Series Based on Angle-distance Penalized Metric Dynamic Time Warping（APMDTW）. This project is used to build an efficient way to measure the time series similarity.
